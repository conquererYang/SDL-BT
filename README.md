# ü§ñ Multi-Robot Coordination for Effective Anomaly Handling in Self-Driving Laboratories
## üöÄ Project Overview

In scientific laboratories, the complexity of experimental processes and high-precision equipment increase the likelihood of anomalies, which can compromise results and pose safety risks. This project addresses these challenges by implementing a **Multi-Robot Coordination Framework** specifically designed for effective anomaly handling in autonomous laboratory environments.

### üîë Key Contributions
- **Anomaly Detection and Handling Framework**: A comprehensive approach that emphasizes restoring standard workflows while maintaining reliability in laboratory settings.
- **Anomaly-Triggered Cross-Behavior Tree Extension Algorithm**: An innovative algorithm that activates upon detecting anomalies, which efficiently manages and localizes issues without extensive re-planning.
- **Comprehensive Experimentation and Validation**: Rigorous testing in both simulated and real environments demonstrates the framework's effectiveness in enhancing fault tolerance and flexibility during anomaly management.

### üìä Anomaly Detection Data Set
Our framework is validated using our **Sdls Anomaly Detect** datasetÔºàhttps://figshare.com/articles/dataset/sdls_anomaly_detect/29234663/1Ôºâ, which includes a variety of scenarios and labeled anomalies commonly encountered in laboratory settings. For detailed methodologies and further reading, refer to the following foundational paper:

### üõ†Ô∏è Methodology
Our framework leverages **Hierarchical Large Language Models (LLMs)** to facilitate intelligent task planning and actions, executing dynamic adjustments in real time. The **Cross-Behavior Tree Expansion Algorithm** effectively identifies and responds to common laboratory anomalies, thus ensuring smooth operation of multi-robot systems.
